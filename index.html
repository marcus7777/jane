<p>Jane initially trained to become an architect at The Bartlett University College London. Her first job in architectural practice was at the BBC. Later at Denys Lasdun Peter Softley and Associates she became fascinated with glass architecture when working in a team on Lasdun's Milton Gate. She was one of the first architecture graduates to take the MSc in light and lighting at The Bartlett .</p>
<p>Her first appointment as a lighting designer was at YRM plc. There she was fortunate to work on Channel Four TV headquarters with Richard Rodgers Partnership and the extension to The Royal Museum of Scotland with Benson and Forsyth. Jane was invited to set up the UK Lighting Division at WSP consulting engineers, which she ran in a bespoke "studio" for ten years. Her first completed project for WSP was The Serpentine Gallery refurbishment. She has also organised many Art and Design Events for clients.</p>
<p>She has been awarded the Fellowship of the Society of Light and Lighting. Already a Senior Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts Jane has a rare breadth of interests bridging both engineering and fine art. She has worked on many Public Art commissions and on collaborative work with artists. Her photography and writing have contributed to an extensive record of her philosophy on design.</p>
<p>To stimulate her work as an artist and photographer Jane rediscovered fellow Yorkshire woman and sculptor Barbara  Hepworth in St Ives . The magnet to see the sunset away from London's skyline became too strong. After twenty years as a frontline designer in London with an impressive portfolio she joined her artist mother to share time in the Peak District and Cornwall to work on her own projects.Her heart is still there.</p>
